# Thota Motors - Auto Service Web App (Frontend)

This is a responsive frontend web application built for Thota Motors, a local auto service center. It showcases the services, gallery, and contact details in a clean and user-friendly layout.

The project is built using React with Vite for fast development, and styled with plain CSS. It is deployed on Netlify and serves as a demonstration of my frontend development skills.
